heap-dump-file
    Java binary heap dump file to be browsed. For a dump file that contains multiple heap dumps, you may specify which dump in the file by appending "#<number> to the file name, i.e. "foo.hprof#3".

DESCRIPTION

The jhat command parses a java heap dump file and launches a webserver. jhat enables you to browse heap dumps using your favorite webbrowser. jhat supports pre-designed queries (such as 'show all instances of a known class "Foo"') as well as OQL (Object Query Language) - a SQL-like query language to query heap dumps. Help on OQL is available from the OQL help page shown by jhat. With the default port, OQL help is available at http://localhost:7000/oqlhelp/

There are several ways to generate a java heap dump:

    Use jmap -dump option to obtain a heap dump at runtime;
    Use jconsole option to obtain a heap dump via HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean at runtime;
    Heap dump will be generated when OutOfMemoryError is thrown by specifying -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError VM option;
    Use hprof.

NOTE: This tool is experimental and may not be available in future versions of the JDK.
